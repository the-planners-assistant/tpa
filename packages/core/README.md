# @tpa/core

This package contains the core logic of The Planner's Assistant.

## Agent

The `Agent` class is the main entry point for the application. It takes a user query and returns a response.

## Usage

```javascript
import Agent from '@tpa/core/src/agent.js';

const agent = new Agent(apiKey);
const response = await agent.run(query);
```

## Document Processing Options

When running a full planning assessment (`assessPlanningApplication`), you can enable a lightweight browser/Node OCR fallback for image‚Äêonly PDFs (e.g. scanned documents) by supplying:

```javascript
await agent.assessPlanningApplication(files, { enableOCR: true });
```

Notes:
- Uses `tesseract.js` on up to 5 extracted images when native PDF text length < 120 chars.
- Concatenated OCR text is merged into `extractedData.fullText` so address and policy extraction can proceed.
- Disable explicitly with `{ enableOCR: false }` (default is enabled internally but only triggers when needed).
