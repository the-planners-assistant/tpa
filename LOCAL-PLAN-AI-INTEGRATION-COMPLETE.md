const scenarioModeler = new ScenarioModeler(db, agent);

// Or enable AI features later
policyEngine.enableAIFeatures(agent);
scenarioModeler.enableAIFeatures(agent);
```

### AI-Enhanced Compliance Check
```javascript
const complianceResult = await policyEngine.runComplianceCheck(
  applicationId, 
  localPlanId, 
  {
    enableAIAnalysis: true,
    confidenceThreshold: 0.7,
    generateRecommendations: true
  }
);

// Access AI insights
console.log(complianceResult.aiAssessment);
console.log(complianceResult.confidence);
console.log(complianceResult.recommendations.ai_insights);
```

```javascript
const scenarioResults = await scenarioModeler.runScenarioModeling(
  scenarioId,
  {
    enableAIAnalysis: true,
    includeOptimization: true
  }
);

// Access AI analysis
console.log(scenarioResults.aiAnalysis);
